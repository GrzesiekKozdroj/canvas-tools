# canvas-tools
this space was used to train myself and develop more html canvas skills and to unerstand many of its concept. <br/>
it is a mess, it contains pieces of code that are dormant and unused, <br/>
it is more like a sketchbook for developing new features for Guild Ball game before integrating them with main game, and because oftheir nature they couldn't be worked upon in the main repo.<br/>
there is nothing to see here....
